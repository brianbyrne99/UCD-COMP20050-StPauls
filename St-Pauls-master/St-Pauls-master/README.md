# Instructions

directory\java -jar stpauls.jar
  
# Format
This software was designed using Java 13 and the Eclipse IDE. The playerTest.java class is a small test designed to demonstrate the functionality of our early programs. 


# Description
This is a Java version of the popular board game "Scrabble". The following classes
should be implemented for the following functionalities:

## Tile Class
Is a very simple class used for creating objects, that will be used as the tiles for our board game.

## Pool Class
Stores tiles in a LinkedList data structure representing the bag and allows tiles to be drawn at random and moved to the Players Frame.

## Frame Class
This class represents the players frame which holds the tiles drawn at random by the player (holds & max at a time), from which the player
can use to play the game.

## Player Class
Is used by the player to keep score and for the player to choose their "player name".

#### Test Classes
Any test classes were written for the purposes of testing funtionality, eliminating errors and improving the game.
